%An eco-economic study is an interdisciplinary analysis that combines ecological and economic evaluations to assess the interactions between the environment and the economy. It aims to evaluate the sustainability and social welfare implications of economic activities and policies, taking into account the ecological impacts and natural resource constraints. The study can help to identify trade-offs and synergies between ecological and economic objectives, and provide insights for decision-makers to achieve sustainable and equitable outcomes.
