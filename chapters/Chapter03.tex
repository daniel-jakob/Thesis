This chapter presents the research methodologies employed in this thesis. \cref{sec:methodoverview} gives a general overview of the study, including a flow chart of the main steps. \cref{sec:methodrefbuild,sec:methodheatingsys} give an overview of the reference building being modelled and the implemented heating system respectively. \cref{sec:methodecoeco} gives an introduction to the ecological and economic models used to quantify the different hybrid operation temperature windows along with a brief overview of the market context. Finally \cref{sec:methodconclusion} provides a conclusion to the methodologies chapter.
