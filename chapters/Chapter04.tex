\section{Location}
The reference house that the building model is based off of a hipped dormer, two-storey residential house located in Belturbet, Cavan, a small town close to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland border, about 125 kilometres from Dublin. The reference house lies at an elevation of 80 metres and is Easterly facing. The dwelling is located in a residential estate, and is thus classified as being located in an urban environment.

\section{Form and Fabric}
The reference model has a floor area of 160 square metres, 93 square metres of which are downstairs, i.e., ``exterior floor'', a gross roof area of 173 square metres and a total external wall surface area of 139 square metrse. There are 21 exterior windows of varying sizes in total and thirteen rooms, seven downstairs and six upstairs. The ceiling height is a uniform 2.5 metres throughout the model. All rooms except for one were considered to be unconditioned, the exception being a very small box room on the ground floor which was interpreted to be a utility room of sorts. The void zones were also unconditioned. The building model geometry and thermal properties were created during previous works by \citeauthor{keogh_technical_2022}. A floor plan schematic can be seen in \cref{fig:floorplan}, showing the ground floor and first floor room layouts and windows. A 3D rendered model of the house can be seen in \cref{fig:3dmodel}. All model data is contained in a \texttt{.idf} file, an input data file interpretable by \texttt{EnergyPlus}. This file contains data about the geometry of the building, envelope construction, thermal and physical properties of the constructions, building and occupancy schedules, internal gains, outside air infiltration to void zones and various other data regarding the simulation process e.g., timestep.

\cref{tbl:extfloorconst} details the specifications of the exterior floor construction for the minimal retrofit model, from top to bottom. The exterior floor is the floor which lays on top of the foundations and therefore conducts heat from the inside of the house to the ground. It consists of concrete at the bottom, insulation board, an air cavity and floor tiles on top.

\section{Schedules, Equipment and Internal Gains}
Internal gains in the context of an energy building simulation of a residential home refers to the heat generated within the envelope by people, appliances, and lighting.

People generate heat through their activities and body heat, while appliances generate heat through their operation. Lighting generates heat due to the inefficiencies in converting electricity into light, and light ultimately being converted to heat energy.

In energy building simulation, internal gains are important to consider because they can significantly affect the energy balance of the building. If the internal gains are high, the building may require less heating, which can lead to energy savings. Conversely, if the internal gains are low, the building may require more heating, which can lead to increased energy consumption and costs. \cite{buttitta_high-temporal_2020}

Internal gains are typically modelled as a heat input to the building, which is then factored into the overall energy balance of the building. The magnitude of internal gains is typically calculated based on the number of occupants, the types and number of appliances, and the lighting levels in the building.

\subsection{Occupancy Gains}
The magnitude of these gains depends on factors such as the number of occupants, their activity levels, and the duration of their stay in the building. It was decided that a house of the size of the reference home was sized for a total of four persons. 

In order to accurately model occupancy gains in a building energy simulation, it is important to use typical occupancy profiles in conjunction with typical metabolic rates for different tasks. A typical occupancy profile is a representation of the number of occupants in the building over time, while a typical metabolic rate is a measure of the heat generated by a person due to their physical activity. Different tasks require different amounts of energy, and therefore result in different levels of heat generation. For example, a person sitting quietly may have a lower metabolic rate than someone performing strenuous physical activity.

\citeauthor{buttitta_high-temporal_2020} \cite{buttitta_high-temporal_2020} developed a stochastic occupancy model which generates hourly occupancy schedules for up to five different types of occupancy profiles of residential buildings for an entire year, based off of data gathered from London, UK. For this thesis, an occupancy profile was chosen which represented the largest share of the population, and two schedules were drawn, one for the weekdays and one for the weekends. These schedules depict the number of persons occupying the dwelling at each hour of the day, and are detailed in \cref{tbl:occupancysched}.

\end{table}

\citetitle{ashrae_ansiashrae_2010} \cite{ashrae_ansiashrae_2010} details the metabolic rate of people performing various tasks, given in Met units, as well as watts per square metre. An activity level schedule was quasi-arbitrarily assembled and is detailed in \cref{tbl:activitysched}.

        1&1&1\\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Lighting}
In the past, internal gains from lighting used to be a significant contributor to the overall heat load of buildings. This was largely due to the widespread use of inefficient incandescent light bulbs, which generated a significant amount of heat as a byproduct of their operation. In fact, it was not uncommon for incandescent bulbs to emit more heat than light, resulting in a significant waste of energy and contributing to higher cooling loads in buildings.

However, with the gradual adoption of more efficient lighting technologies such as LED bulbs, internal gains from lighting have become much less of a concern. LED bulbs are significantly more efficient than incandescent bulbs, converting a higher percentage of their energy input into light rather than heat. This means that they generate far less waste heat, resulting in lower cooling loads and reduced energy consumption. \citefield{ISO17772}{shorttitle} presents lighting schedules and load density profiles for single family residential homes, and are reproduced in \cref{tbl:lightandequip}. 

\subsection{Plug Loads and Equipment}
Plug loads in a residential home refer to the energy consumed by appliances and devices that are plugged into electrical outlets, such as televisions, computers, and kitchen appliances. Equipment internal gains in a residential home refer to the heat generated by the operation of various equipment and appliances, such as refrigerators, ovens, and water heaters. This heat can contribute to the overall heat load of the home, particularly during periods of high use. \citefield{ISO17772}{shorttitle} gives details regarding standards for schedules and load density profiles for equipment gains and plug loads, and is reproduced in \cref{tbl:lightandequip}.
