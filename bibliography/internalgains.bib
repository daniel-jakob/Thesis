	abstract = {Building stock modelling usually deploys representative building archetypes to obtain reliable results of annual energy heating demand and to minimise the associated computational cost. Available methodologies define archetypes considering only the physical characteristics of buildings. Uniform occupancy schedules, which correspond to national averages, are generally used in archetype energy simulations, despite evidence of occupancy schedules which can vary considerably for each building. This paper presents a new methodology to define occupancy-integrated archetypes. The novel feature of these archetype models is the integration of different occupancy schedules within the archetype itself. This allows building stock energy simulations of national population subgroups characterised by specific occupancy profiles to be undertaken. The importance of including occupant-related data in residential archetypes, which is different than the national average, is demonstrated by applying the methodology to the {UK} national building stock. The resultant occupancy-integrated archetypes are then modelled to obtain the annual final heating energy demand. It is shown that the relative difference between the heating demand of occupancy-integrated archetypes and uniform occupancy archetypes can be up to 30\%.},

	abstract = {A strong correlation exists between occupant behaviour and space heating energy use. In particular, the occupancy status (e.g., daytime absence) is known to have a significant influence on residential heating load profiles, as well as on cumulative heating energy consumption. In the literature, many occupancy models have been utilised to predict occupancy profiles of individual dwellings as part of the larger residential building stock. However, none of the existing models consider diversity associated with occupancy-integrated archetypes to generate high-temporal resolution heating load profiles. The current paper uses Time Use Survey ({TUS}) data to develop a high-temporal resolution residential building occupancy model. The key feature of the proposed model, implemented using {MATLAB}, is the ability to generate stochastic occupancy time-series data for national population subgroups characterised by specific occupancy profiles. It is shown that the results are capable of closely approximating data available from {TUS}. The developed model can be applied to improve the quality of modelled high-temporal resolution heating load profiles for generic building stock characterised by population subgroups represented by different occupancy-integrated archetypes. A case study is performed on a building stock sample located in London, {UK}. The developed occupancy model has been implemented in {MATLAB} and is available for download.},

	shorttitle = {Comparison of four building archetype characterization methods in urban building energy modeling ({UBEM})},
	abstract = {Significant research effort has gone into developing bottom-up, physics based, urban building energy modeling ({UBEM}) tools, which allow evaluating district-wide energy demand and supply strategies. In order to reduce the simulation inputs required in {UBEM}, groups of buildings are typically classified into representative “archetypes”. This approach necessarily simplifies the real diversity of occupant behaviors and construction variations, reducing in turn the variety of predicted building energy demands. To further understand the limitations of archetype-based modeling, this paper evaluates four characterization methods of increasing complexity, by comparing simulation results to measured Energy Use Intensity ({EUI}) distributions of 336 residential buildings in a district in Kuwait City. The first two methods follow a typical deterministic approach, organizing buildings into one and four archetypes respectively, while the third method introduces probabilistic uncertainty modeling for occupant related parameters. The fourth method introduces a new “Bayesian” calibration technique for archetype parameters, and applies it to occupant parameters in method three. In a first step, frequency calibrated distributions for occupancy, lighting power density, plug load density and cooling set points are generated through parametric modeling from a test set consisting of about half of the 336 buildings. The resulting joint distribution of parameters is then sampled using Latin Hyper Cube ({LHC}) for the probabilistic simulation of the remaining urban model. The comparison of simulated {EUI} distributions with measured data suggests that the proposed probabilistic Bayesian calibration leads to significantly closer predictions, with a maximum error in the 10th and 90th percentiles of 15\% against 55\%, 60\% and 29\% for the other three methods.},

	abstract = {In the context of the European building stock, more than 50 \% of buildings were built before 1960, and it has been estimated that 75 \% of the current building stock will still exist in 2050. A typical approach to estimate energy consumption at multiple scales is by using archetypes which are the cohort of representative buildings with similar characteristics. Typically, archetypes are classified based on year of construction, type of dwelling and type of heating system. Since, this classification does not account for the stochastic nature of occupancy, a typical occupant presence pattern from the literature is considered. This study develops a methodology to generate stochastic occupancy profiles using the {UK} Time Use Survey ({TUS}) 2014-15 data. The occupancy profiles take into account the affect of the day of the week, the month of the year, the number of residents in the household and the type of dwelling. To test the methodology, we used the Irish residential building archetypes and 5-8\% variations in energy use intensity are observed using the developed occupancy profiles for an apartment archetype having one and two occupants. The generated occupancy profiles facilitate the pathway to develop robust archetypes for reliable energy prediction at an urban scale. Furthermore, robust archetypes allow policymakers and urban planners to recommend appropriate energy efficiency measures for the sustainable development of residential building sector.},
