	title = {A Technical and Economic Assessment of Hybrid Gas Heat Pump Systems as a Retrofit Measure for the Irish Residential Building Stock},
	abstract = {Energy use in buildings is a significant proportion of total world energy consumption, it is therefore imperative on the road to decarbonisation to alter this current trend of high energy consumption in buildings. With current market sentiments agreeing that a reduction in energy consumption is required to reduce the effects that anthropogenic emissions are having on the climate, it is clear that the residential building stock is a good place to investigate with regard to a reduction in energy consumption for the provision of space heating. Space heating accounts for 32\% and 23\% of primary and final energy consumption in Ireland respectively, indicating that a reduction in this sector could lead to a large reduction in Irelands overall energy consumption.},
