	abstract = {Air–water heat pumps suffer from reduced thermal output and poor efficiency in cold conditions. As a consequence, they are usually vastly overdimensioned for most of the heating season. These inherent disadvantages are largely mitigated in hybrid systems, in which a second heat generator provides heating support when required. In this work, a hybrid heat pump system for existing buildings consisting of a retrofitted air–water heat pump and a gas boiler is modeled and examined in full-year dynamic numerical simulations. It is benchmarked with comparable monovalent systems for a 1970s’ single family home as well as a renovated variant of the same building. The nominal thermal output of the {AWHP} as well as the volume of the buffer storage tank are varied in order to study their impact on system performance. With the renovated building model, significantly higher efficiencies ({SPF} 3.88 vs. 3.34) and load factors (0.57 vs. 0.36) are achieved. Medium-sized heat pumps attain the highest {SPF} values, the reason for which is rooted in the alternative-parallel bivalent operation scheme and the dependency of the bivalence point on the heat pump characteristic. The volume of the buffer storage tank has very limited impact on system performance.},

	abstract = {Air source heat pumps suffer from reduced thermal delivery in cold climate conditions. In this study, the parallel loop hybrid system with the combination of heat pump and gas fired water heater in one device is provided as the sustainable alternative to alleviate such issues. An economic-based new control strategy has been proposed for the hybrid system to investigate the system thermal performance and reveal the economic benefits for residential space heating application. The climate conditions, fuel source price ratio and gas heater thermal efficiency have been included in the analysis of the hybrid performance. Under the operating map, the control strategy can lead to a ∼10\% to ∼60\% system operating economic benefits for space heating application for −12 °C to 20 °C ambient. Raising the price ratio can decrease the ratio of the heat delivered by the heat pump on the overall heat loading, especially for higher final water target temperatures. Lowering the price ratio can improve the energy process saving potential (\% gas heater heating mode baseline). In addition, several typical cities have also been investigated as a part of studies for hybrid performances and environmental impacts.},

	abstract = {A problem with using heat pumps to heat buildings lies in the limited power available due to the need to avoid oversizing, which would reduce the life of the machine. This problem is often solved by adding an electrical heating element, but the low efficiency of such a solution makes it worthwhile to adopt a hybrid system consisting of a heat pump combined with a condensing boiler, which can operate even when the heat pump's performance falls below that of the boiler. The purpose of this paper is to assess the energy performance of a hybrid unit by means of dynamic simulations, comparing it with a heat pump with electrical integration in a single-family home built in the 1970s and located in Milan. In a previous study, the same model was used to perform a similar analysis on a Stirling {microCHP} unit, so the present work completes the analysis of the most innovative generators for space heating in residential buildings. The simulations showed that hybrid systems can achieve a high generation efficiency whereas heat pumps with electrical integration are unable to improve on the generation efficiency of a condensing gas boiler in the case examined.},
