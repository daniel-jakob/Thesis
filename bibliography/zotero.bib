	abstract = {Air–water heat pumps suffer from reduced thermal output and poor efficiency in cold conditions. As a consequence, they are usually vastly overdimensioned for most of the heating season. These inherent disadvantages are largely mitigated in hybrid systems, in which a second heat generator provides heating support when required. In this work, a hybrid heat pump system for existing buildings consisting of a retrofitted air–water heat pump and a gas boiler is modeled and examined in full-year dynamic numerical simulations. It is benchmarked with comparable monovalent systems for a 1970s’ single family home as well as a renovated variant of the same building. The nominal thermal output of the {AWHP} as well as the volume of the buffer storage tank are varied in order to study their impact on system performance. With the renovated building model, significantly higher efficiencies ({SPF} 3.88 vs. 3.34) and load factors (0.57 vs. 0.36) are achieved. Medium-sized heat pumps attain the highest {SPF} values, the reason for which is rooted in the alternative-parallel bivalent operation scheme and the dependency of the bivalence point on the heat pump characteristic. The volume of the buffer storage tank has very limited impact on system performance.},

	abstract = {Air source heat pumps suffer from reduced thermal delivery in cold climate conditions. In this study, the parallel loop hybrid system with the combination of heat pump and gas fired water heater in one device is provided as the sustainable alternative to alleviate such issues. An economic-based new control strategy has been proposed for the hybrid system to investigate the system thermal performance and reveal the economic benefits for residential space heating application. The climate conditions, fuel source price ratio and gas heater thermal efficiency have been included in the analysis of the hybrid performance. Under the operating map, the control strategy can lead to a ∼10\% to ∼60\% system operating economic benefits for space heating application for −12 °C to 20 °C ambient. Raising the price ratio can decrease the ratio of the heat delivered by the heat pump on the overall heat loading, especially for higher final water target temperatures. Lowering the price ratio can improve the energy process saving potential (\% gas heater heating mode baseline). In addition, several typical cities have also been investigated as a part of studies for hybrid performances and environmental impacts.},

	abstract = {A problem with using heat pumps to heat buildings lies in the limited power available due to the need to avoid oversizing, which would reduce the life of the machine. This problem is often solved by adding an electrical heating element, but the low efficiency of such a solution makes it worthwhile to adopt a hybrid system consisting of a heat pump combined with a condensing boiler, which can operate even when the heat pump's performance falls below that of the boiler. The purpose of this paper is to assess the energy performance of a hybrid unit by means of dynamic simulations, comparing it with a heat pump with electrical integration in a single-family home built in the 1970s and located in Milan. In a previous study, the same model was used to perform a similar analysis on a Stirling {microCHP} unit, so the present work completes the analysis of the most innovative generators for space heating in residential buildings. The simulations showed that hybrid systems can achieve a high generation efficiency whereas heat pumps with electrical integration are unable to improve on the generation efficiency of a condensing gas boiler in the case examined.},

A possible solution is to size the heat pump to cover only a fraction of the peak load using a second heat generator in “hybrid heat pump system”. In this study, a dynamic model of a hybrid system was built, and several seasonal simulations were carried out (considering two different climates) to study how the choice of the cut off temperature can influence the annual efficiency of the system and to understand if a bivalent parallel plant can lead to energy savings compared to a bivalent alternative system. With both the considered climates, when a large size heat pump is selected (low bivalent temperature), there might be no benefits by setting a cut off temperature lower than the bivalent temperature, and the differences between the energy performances of the bivalent alternative system and those of the bivalent parallel system are negligible. On the other hand, when a low size heat pump is preferred (high bivalent temperature), the bivalent parallel system can lead to appreciable energy savings compared to a bivalent alternative plant. The main economic advantages of a hybrid system, with respect to the monovalent heat-pump plant, comes from the lower annual electric and gas energy needs.},

	abstract = {The effect of the frost growth and frost morphology on the performance of an air source heat pump was investigated experimentally. The frost thickness, frost accumulation and the dynamic performance of the heat pump were measured. It is found that the frost growth can be divided into three stages according to the frost morphology. In the initial stage, condensed water freezes and forms a transparent thin ice layer on the fins and tubes firstly, then the granular ices appear and grow gradually on the ice layer, and the column-shaped ice crystals are formed at last. The growth rate of the frost thickness, the heating capacity and {COP} of the heat pump increase with the frosting time significantly until the column-shaped frost layer is formed. In the second stage, the column-shaped ice crystals grow in its radius rather than in its length, and the frost thickness growth rate decreases or remains to be constant. However, the heating capacity and {COP} of the heat pump are only slightly affected by frosting on the outdoor coils. In the third stage, the ice crystals mainly grow in its length, and become gradually of an acerose-shaped one, finally a fluffy frost layer is formed. The frost thickness growth rate is about 2–4 times of that in the second stage. The drops per minute in the heating capacity and {COP} are increased by several times of those in the second stage. In addition, it is found that the frost growth rate and the drop in the performance of the heat pump are highest when the outdoor air temperature is about 0°C with various relative humidity. The experimental results are in agreement with the corresponding simulation data except in the third frosting stage.},

Though {HPs} are a well-known technology, the estimation of their actual energy performance is still under discussion. Indeed, the proper choice of the {HP} design parameters (e.g. size, rated supply temperature) and the adopted control strategy can assume a paramount role to cover the mismatch between declared and actual performance of the system. Objective of this work is to analyze this mutual dependence in an operating system to provide guidelines for the design of a residential heating system with a {HP}. Through a dynamic energy simulation tool, a variable-load air-to-water {HP} is used to cover the thermal demand of a residential building. The effect of the reciprocal influence of different design choices (e.g. rated heating capacity or design supply temperature) and control strategies (e.g. climatic regulation) is analyzed by simulating different scenarios. To complete the evaluation, the impact of a thermal energy storage is also assessed. The study allows to identify guidelines for the design of different system configurations and results seem to confirm the impact of the investigated parameters on the seasonal performance of the system.},

While air source heat pumps can provide outstanding performance at high ambient temperatures, their efficiency (strictly their coefficient of performance) and capacity both degrade at low ambient temperatures when heating demand is highest. Some homeowners utilize hybrid (or dualfuel) heating systems, which use a heat pump at high ambient temperatures and a furnace at lower temperatures when the heat pump's capacity is insufficient. These hybrid systems allow the homeowner to avoid the additional capital cost of installing a larger heat pump to meet peak heating demand. This study discusses heating choices for single family homes that currently use a central air unit for cooling alongside a natural gas orfuel oilfurnace for heating. We determine that in most {US} climate zones, it is prudent to replace an air conditioner at the end of its life with a heat pump sizedfor the peak cooling load and operate it in tandem with the existing furnace. We also assess the emission implications of such a conversion and determine the electricity prices below which a homeowner will break even over the investment's lifetime.},

	abstract = {The residential heating sector can offer significant load-shifting possibilities to the energy system. Currently 400,000 households in Denmark are heated by natural gas boilers. The power consumption corresponding to these boilers can offer high value to the stabilization of the wind intensive Danish energy system. Gas electric hybrid heat pumps ({GEHHPs}) are individual heat pumps consisting of an electric heat pump and a gas boiler. They enable a fully flexible operation of electric heat pumps by supplementing electricity with gas when necessary. In this paper, we construct a cost optimization model of a {GEHHP} and compare the levelized cost of heat of this system with other individual heating systems. We investigate the changes in the operation schedule of the {GEHHP}, both from a socio- and a private-economic perspective, and analyze how certain economic and technological framework conditions influence their operation schedule. Our article shows that the end-consumer's optimal operation schedule uses the gas boiler component of the {GEHHP} 24\% of the time. Additionally, comparing the levelized cost of heat of the {GEHHP} with other heating alternatives proves that the {GEHHP} setup is the most cost efficient individual heating alternative.

A residential building located in Stuttgart, Germany, equipped with a hybrid heat pump which is coupled with a thermal energy storage unit and a gas boiler is used as a case study. A model predictive control algorithm is used to minimise the daily operational cost over a full heating season. Several demand response programs based on controlling the heat pump power consumption were tested and analysed by adopting different metrics capable of describing the flexibility potential and cost of demand response programs. Several tariff structures, including: real-time pricing, two-level day-night tariffs and critical-peak pricing with both fixed and variable feed-in price components, were investigated. The results show that the building can provide up to 1370 {kWhe} of energy flexibility over the heating season with an average specific (marginal) costs of between €0.024–0.035 per {kWhe} of flexibility provided. The demand response programs lead to higher utilisation of thermal energy storage along with increased boiler consumption, by up to 17.1\% and 12.1\%, respectively in case of maximum demand response intensity. This in turn leads to a higher overall primary energy consumption of between 1.6\% and 9.1\% depending on demand response intensity. Typically, real-time pricing is the most favourable tariff structure, capable of offering the greatest energy flexibility with lowest associated electricity costs.},

A high efficiency natural gas furnace ({NGF}) and an electric air source heat pump ({ASHP}) were coupled together to meet the space heating demand of the house. This integrated system is called the cloud based Smart Dual Fuel Switching System ({SDFSS}) that considers time-of-use ({TOU}) pricing, fuel cost, short-term weather forecast, and equipment efficiencies and capacities. This multi-variable decision-making process defines an optimal schedule for the hybrid system to run more cost effectively. This paper analyses two separate {SDFSSs}. According to these analyses, the {SDFSS} systems showed lower operating cost with respect to the furnace or the {ASHP} system alone with various carbon tax ({CT}) levels from \$0 to \$250/tonne of {CT} with an increment of \$10/tonne of {CT} that were simulated, along with a significant {GHG} emission reduction relative to the conventional heating systems. Furthermore, with these technologies, Canada’s residential sector could potentially meet Canada’s Paris Agreement goals.

	abstract = {Hybrid heat pump systems are a suitable solution to mitigate the well-known disadvantages of air-source heat pumps, such as energy losses linked to defrost cycles and a significant reduction of their heating capacity during the most severe part of the season. In hybrid systems the heat pump is sized to satisfy only a fraction of the building peak load and is coupled to a second heater (back-up device), which helps the heat pump during the coldest part of the winter. In this paper, a series of dynamic simulations has been performed to calculate the seasonal performance of hybrid systems based on an air-to-water heat pump and to assess the optimal configuration of the system. Results point out that the energy performance of these systems strongly depends on the heat pump sizing, the back-up device typology and the control algorithm used for the activation of the heat generators. It is demonstrated that the adoption of hybrid systems in which the heat pump is coupled to a gas boiler allows to obtain relevant primary energy savings. The overall seasonal efficiency can be increased up to 6\% and 22\%, if compared to monovalent systems respectively based on a heat pump or a gas boiler, only if the heaters are activated following an alternative operating mode, with a cut-off temperature selected between the design and the bivalent temperature. On the contrary, if the back-up device of the hybrid system is an electric resistance, the heaters have to work in parallel during the whole heating season and the only achievable advantage is that the heat pump can be slightly under-sized with respect to the nominal building load.},

	abstract = {The ongoing decarbonisation process of the current energy system, driven by the {EU} directives, requires that more renewable energy sources are integrated in the global energy mix, as well as policies promoting investments in new low-carbon technologies, energy efficiency and grid infrastructure. The technical integration of renewable energy sources into the existing power system is not straightforward, due to the intrinsic aleatory characteristics of renewable production, which make the power grid balance harder. To handle this issue, beside the traditional supply-side management, grid flexibility can also be provided by enabling the active participation of the demand-side in power system operational procedures, by means of the so-called demand-side management ({DSM}). The present paper is aimed at assessing the ability of a cost-optimal control strategy, based on model predictive control, to activate demand-response ({DR}) actions in a residential building equipped with a hybrid heat pump generator coupled with a water thermal storage. Hourly electricity prices are considered as external signals from the grid driving the demand response actions. It is shown that the thermal energy storage turns out to be an effective way to improve the controller performances and make the system more flexible and able to provide services to the power grid. A daily cost-saving up to 35\% and 15\% have been highlighted with a 1 m3 0.5.m3 tanks, respectively. Finally, the achievable flexibility is shown to be strictly dependent on the storage capacity and operations, which in turn are affected by the generators sizing.},

	abstract = {Heat pump water heaters have been introduced to improve energy efficiency of water heating in buildings. Although much research has been conducted to make up for weak points of heat pumps which occur when their purpose is converted from air-conditioning into water heating, there remain some points to be improved to perform as stably as conventional water heaters. Recently, the hybrid water heating system, which is the combination of a heat pump and a traditional gas fired water heater, is proposed as an alternative water heater to perform more efficient water heating stably. In this paper, the hybrid system is designed for general residential houses in Korea, which have floor area of 106.47m2 and its performance characteristics are analyzed numerically. To obtain the performance of a hybrid water heating system, the mathematical models of heat pump components and the correlation, which is derived from experimental data of a gas fired water heater, are applied. Also, using the result of a performance calculation, the economic feasibility study is carried out, with the concept of energy cost savings, to quantify the merits of the system and to establish its operation strategy. The monthly electricity and heat consumption data in a Korean residential house and the price of electricity and gas are applied to reflect an actual situation.},

	abstract = {Air-to-water heat pumps ({HPs}) are widely installed in new buildings; however, they face performance degradation with high temperature emission systems, which is typical of existing buildings, or during domestic hot water ({DHW}) production. Hybrid systems ({HSs}), composed by air-to-water {HPs} and gas-fired boilers, can mitigate these issues by increasing the overall system efficiency. {HS} performance is strictly dependent on the configuration and control management of the system itself. Moreover, the building and heating plant also have a strong influence. This study presents an overview of the application of {HSs} that considers both space heating ({SH}) and {DHW} production, by comparing the primary energy ({PE}) consumption obtained by dynamic simulations. Different climates, building typologies, and {DHW} withdrawal profiles are used to extend the results’ validity. Additionally, several {HS} control strategies were implemented and compared. The results show a {PE} savings ranging from 5\% to 22\% depending on the control strategy and the external parameters applied in the simulation. The comparison of the control strategies shows that the most efficient strategies are the ones maximizing heat pump utilization. The dependence of {PE} savings of {HS} on {COP} values is highlighted, and a correlation is presented to provide designers with guidance on the applicability of {HSs}.},

	abstract = {This study reviewed the defrosting techniques applicable for the heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and refrigeration industry, including passive, active, and system techniques. The passive methods normally use treated surfaces by changing the surface morphology through micro-grooved, anti-frost coating, hydrophilic, hydrophilic, or superhydropholic coating. For passive defrosting techniques, the microgrooved surfaces can improve the drainage of the frost melt effectively. It is generally agreed that the superhydropholic coating can delay the initialization of frosting and provides less water adhesion during defrosting. Yet defrosting performance for hydrophobic surfaces outperforms hydrophilic and uncoated surfaces. Active and system techniques, including electrohydrodynamic ({EHD}), low-frequency oscillation, and ultrasonic vibration methods, hot gas reverse cycle, electric heater, desiccant dehumidifiers and controlling strategies are reviewed. The {EHD} defrosting method is proved to be comparatively effective in natural or laminar flow operation. Test results also indicate that utilization of alternative current source is superior to the direct current source. The electrode with negative polarity is better than positive polarity as far as frost accumulation is concerned. The low-frequency oscillation is ineffective in defrosting while ultrasonic vibration provides effective frost removal and can delay the frost growth appreciably. Test results indicate that the ultrasonic oscillation poses considerable positive influence on defrosting either operated continuously or intermittently, in direct contact or not. For system defrosting, the hot gas reverse cycle is comparatively expensive to install but the efficiency, {COP}, and energy consumption are superior to the other system methods. Desiccants, either solid or liquid, can be employed in association with the system defrosting methods to lower energy consumption. There were various controlling strategies to detect the frost formation and to decide the best time to initiate defrosting. However, many of them were applicable to some specific systems and environments and require further investigations to test the relevant reliability, stability, and repeatability.},

However, in almost all the studies, ethylene glycol water solution was used as refrigerant, which made the investigating of frost distribution and growth difficult due to the uneven temperature distribution along the tube length. Furthermore, quantitative experimental data for the frost distribution and growth on {FTHXs} have been insufficient. Therefore, in this paper, a quantitative experimental study using R410A as refrigerant on frost distribution and growth on two {FTHXs} with different fin pitches is reported. The study results demonstrated that the frost accumulated on an {FTHX} could be divided into two parts, one accumulated on the edge of windward fins and the other on the surfaces of fins and tubes. Furthermore, the ratios of the frost mass accumulated on the edge of windward fins to that on the entire {FTHX} surface were 13.7\% (60 min frosting duration) and 12.5\% (120 min frosting duration) for the two {FTHXs}, respectively.

At certain outside air conditions, when it operates in heating mode, frost can form on the air-cooled heat exchanger, decreasing the heating performance. Conventionally, reverse-cycle defrosting ({RCD}) has been the common method of frost removal. But this method requires the interruption of heating during defrosting, as well as a period of time to reheat the cooled pipes of the indoor units after defrosting. In this study, a new technology called continuous heating was developed, which utilize only a hot gas bypass valve to remove the frost from the outdoor heat exchanger and thus enabling the supply of hot air to indoors without any interruption. For this, a new high temperature and low pressure gas bypass method was designed, which is differentiated from the common high pressure hot gas bypass methods by its use of low pressure. Various refrigerant mass flow distributions were examined, and the most effective defrosting mass flow was 50\% in this case. Heating capacity was increased by 17\% because of continuous heating, and the cumulated energy efficiency was increased by 8\% compared to the traditional reverse cycle defrosting over 4h including two defrost operations. Also, cumulated energy efficiency was increased by 27\% compared to electronic heaters that supply the same heating capacity during defrosting. By this new technology, it has been proved that continuous heating and energy savings could be achieved without adopting expensive technologies.},

	abstract = {In the paper, a model for the simulation and the optimization of a novel solar trigeneration system is presented. The plant simulation model is designed to supply electricity, space heating or cooling and domestic hot water for a small residential building. The system is based on a solar field equipped with flat-plate photovoltaic/thermal collectors, coupled with a water-to-water electric heat pump/chiller. The electrical energy produced by the hybrid collectors is entirely supplied to the building. During the winter, the thermal energy available from the solar field is used as a heat source for the evaporator of the heat pump and/or to produce domestic hot water. During the summer, the heat pump operates in cooling mode, coupled with a closed circuit cooling tower, providing space cooling for the building, and the hot water produced by the collectors is only used to produce domestic hot water. For such a system, a dynamic simulation model was developed in {TRNSYS} environment, paying special attention to the dynamic simulation of the building, too. The system was analyzed from an energy and economic point of view, considering different time bases. In order to minimize the pay-back period, an optimum set of the main design/control parameters was obtained by means of a sensitivity analysis. Simultaneously, a computer-based Design of Experiment procedure was implemented, aiming at calculating the optimal set of design parameters, using both energy and economic objective functions. The results showed that thermal and electrical efficiencies are above 40\% and 10\%, respectively. The coefficient of performance of the reversible heat pump resulted above 4 for both heating and cooling modes. For the base case, a Simple Pay Back period of 5.36years was found; such index decreases to 2.33years in case a capital investment incentive of 30\% is available. As expected, a decrease of the performance of the system was detected for weather conditions in which the availability of solar energy is scarce. The Design of Experiments analysis outlined that the appropriate selection of collector area is crucial in order to achieve a good profitability of the system under analysis.},

	abstract = {{ASHP} system is extensively applied to maintain indoor thermal environment but contributes to high building energy consumption. Better energy efficiency is possible through cooling performance improvements. This study investigates, using full-scale experiments, the cooling performance of {ASHP}. In the series of experiments, we vary the major influencing factors—evaporator inlet air temperature, air velocity, and compressor frequency and measured their impacts on response variables that include cooling capacity, compressor power, and the {COP}. The design of experiment ({DOE}) approach is used to plan and analyze the experiments. The results show that cooling capacity of {ASHP} system significantly increases with the rising evaporator inlet air temperature, air velocity, and compressor frequency. However, because of increasing fan and compressor power with rising air velocity and compressor frequency, {COP} dramatically decrease. Finally, the study of develop a simple predictive model for assessing the {COP} of {ASHP}. Comparing with the predicted and experimental results shows an agreement within 10\% deviation, which indicates the suitability of the prediction model. Therefore, a predictive model can help system operators to set the optimal design parameters for achieving optimal {COP} performance of {ASHP} system.},

Both tank sizes were 150 L. The {COPs} and the electrical energies consumed were determined from the controlled volume of hot water drawn off from each tank, at different time of use periods, during the summer and winter seasons. The results depicted that the average month-day {COPs} of the specific volume of hot water drawn off (50, 100 and 150 L) from the split and integrated type {ASHP} water heaters, were above 2. In addition, the p-values derived from the one-way {ANOVA} test and the Kruskal–Wallis tests of the groups’ {COPs} of the split and integrated type {ASHP} water heaters, during the winter and summer seasons, were smaller than 0.01 and confirmed significant differences at the 99\% confidence level.},

	abstract = {There are various factors having an impact on the energetic and exergetic performance (i.e., {COP} and {eCOP}) of an absorption refrigeration systems ({ARS}) such as the temperatures of the generator, condenser, evaporator and absorber, effectiveness of solution, refrigerant and solution-refrigerant heat exchangers and isentropic efficiency of the solution pump. Many studies have focused on these process parameters, but the importance order and contribution ratios of the parameters due to thermodynamic performance have not been determined by using statistical methods. Firstly, in this study, cycles’ thermodynamic model is established and the variation of the {COP} and {eCOP} are calculated for different working conditions with different parameters ranges. The effects of these parameters on the {COP} and {eCOP} are examined separately on a statistical basis. The importance order of the parameters are determined by using Taguchi and {ANOVA} methods and the results are compared. Optimum operating conditions are determined by means of statistical analysis for the {COP} and {eCOP}. Under these operating conditions, the {COP} and {eCOP} of the system are calculated as 0.697 and 0.2829, respectively. Furthermore, for the simultaneous maximization of these two performance indicators, Taguchi-Grey Relational Analysis ({GRA}) is used. By using this analysis, importance order of the examined parameters on multiple performance characteristics are determined. The absorber and evaporator temperatures are the most efficient parameters on multiple performance characteristics with a contribution ratio of 29.66\% and 26.34\% of the total effect while the least efficient parameters are the pump efficiency and effectiveness of solution-refrigerant heat exchanger with a contribution ratio of 0.48\% and 2.41\%, respectively. For the best condition considering the multiple performance characteristics, {COP} and {eCOP} of the system are found as 0.6255 and 0.2829, respectively.},
