	abstract = {Gas-driven sorption heat pumps ({GDSHP}) show significant potential to reduce primary energy use, associated emissions and energy costs for space heating and domestic hot water production in residential applications. This study considered a bivalent heating system consisting of a sorption heat pump and a condensing boiler, and focuses on the optimal heating capacity of each of these components relative to each other. Two bivalent systems were considered: one based on a solid chemisorption cycle ({GDSHPA}), and one based on a resorption cycle ({GDSHPB}). Simulations of year-round space heating loads for two single-family houses, one in New York and the other Minnesota, were carried out and the seasonal gas coefficient of performance ({SGCOP}) calculated. The sorption heat pump’s design heating capacity as a fraction of the bivalent system’s total heating capacity was varied from 0 to 100\%. Results show that {SGCOP} was effectively constant for sorption heat pump design capacity greater than 41\% of the peak bivalent {GDSHPA} design capacity in Minnesota, and 32\% for {GDSHPB}. In New York, these values were 42\% and 34\% for {GDSHPA} and {GDSHPB} respectively. The payback period was also evaluated based on postulated sorption heat pump component costs. The fastest payback was achieved with sorption heat pump design capacity between 22 and 44\%.},

For this purpose, we perform a complete description of the {EU} heating sector compliant with official statistics and decompose the {EU} power demand in different uses to define and assess different levels of heat electrification. We find that heat electrification is an effective decarbonisation option, which can reduce the total energy related emissions by up to 17\%, if paired with simultaneous expansion of low-carbon energy. Due to the relative sizes of heat and power demands, we find that most national power systems could cope with higher heat-electrification rates. Specifically, an additional heat pump capacity in the order of 1.1–1.6 {TWth} can be deployed based on the existing firm power capacity, which would correspond to a heat pump share of 29–45\% in space heating. Based on their current power capacity, 12 Member States are prepared for even full electrification scenarios, whereas three Member States could get their power system stressed if 40–60\% of all fossil-fuelled technologies are substituted. Flexible electric demand is identified as a key enabler of larger heat electrification shares.},

Indeed, the flexible gas infrastructure adapts to load while electricity demand variations cause risk of black-out. The impacts of two hybrid technologies are studied at transformer level with 1-min experimental load profiles of 40 dwellings equipped with micro Combined Heat and Power (μ{CHP}) boilers over a year in France. An absolute peak load reduction by 17\% at small scale is found. Different technology mixes are then simulated to assess the effect on local infrastructure. Finally a methodology for temperature dependence analysis of load is used to assess different potential benefits of gas technologies.},

Hybrid heaters combine different heating appliances in one device and can switch between those appliances during operation. Different configurations are possible: B-R (gas boiler-resistance), {HP}-B (heat pump-gas boiler), and {HP}-R (heat pump-resistance) heaters. A linear programming investment model is formulated and applied to an Irish test system with 40\% wind energy generation to determine the optimal capacities and dispatch for the power and residential heat systems, including thermal storage. No technology is a silver bullet, but this paper finds that the widespread deployment of hybrid {HP}-B systems delivers a wide range of cost and strategic benefits: This hybrid technology minimises total system cost, reduces gas consumption and {CO}2 emissions compared to B-only, and, compared to {HP}-only, reduces power generation capacity requirements and heater capital cost. Other hybrid heaters are effective in addressing a specific challenge, although with drawbacks: Hybrid B-Rs considerably reduce wind curtailment, but increase the use of carbon-intensive coal generation; {HP}-Rs mainly only benefit consumers by reducing heater capital cost compared to {HPs} and require more generation capacity additions and thermal storage tanks.},

The model results are validated with the experimental data available in literature, of four {ASHPs} in the 2.7 {kW}−5.8 {kW} capacity range. 4 {kW} capacity {ASHP} is taken as reference. Constant heating ({CH}), constant work ({CW}) and variable heating ({VH}) modes are determined as operating modes. The model results reveal that relative humidity is a performance enhancing factor above frosting conditions. In {VH} mode, which is the most realistic operating mode for residences, raise in outdoor temperature from 7 °C to 14 °C increases the {COP} value by 30\%, and raise in the relative humidity from 0.6 to 1.0 provides an additional 5\% {COP} increase. In {CH} and {CW} modes, the contribution of relative humidity to performance increases with temperature, up to 10.7\% and 6.4\%, respectively. Correlations giving the {COP} change rate with respect to ambient temperature and relative humidity are derived with higher than 0.9839 R2 values for dry and humid conditions of the {CH}, {CW} and {VH} operating modes.

Due to the growing popularity of air-to-air or air-to-water heat pumps in the building sector, the problem of the evaporator heat exchanger freezing is also becoming more and more relevant. As the outdoor temperature drops, so does the heat pump’s coefficient of performance ({COP}) for heating. The freezing of the evaporator surface increases the energy consumption of the system, has a negative effect on heat exchange, distorts the normal operating cycle of the heat pump and the energy is wasted for defrosting processes. This article describes the experimental investigation of an air-to-water heat pump, presents the results obtained during the experiments and their interfaces. The experiments were carried out during the transitional/cold season. It was found that frost formation on the evaporator started when the outdoor temperature was {\textless}3.5 °C and the relative humidity reached 88\%. The defrosting cycle took an average of 5 min. The impact of the evaporator freezing on the operation and {COP} of the heat pump was assessed.},

	abstract = {This study reviewed the defrosting techniques applicable for the heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and refrigeration industry, including passive, active, and system techniques. The passive methods normally use treated surfaces by changing the surface morphology through micro-grooved, anti-frost coating, hydrophilic, hydrophilic, or superhydropholic coating. For passive defrosting techniques, the microgrooved surfaces can improve the drainage of the frost melt effectively. It is generally agreed that the superhydropholic coating can delay the initialization of frosting and provides less water adhesion during defrosting. Yet defrosting performance for hydrophobic surfaces outperforms hydrophilic and uncoated surfaces. Active and system techniques, including electrohydrodynamic ({EHD}), low-frequency oscillation, and ultrasonic vibration methods, hot gas reverse cycle, electric heater, desiccant dehumidifiers and controlling strategies are reviewed. The {EHD} defrosting method is proved to be comparatively effective in natural or laminar flow operation. Test results also indicate that utilization of alternative current source is superior to the direct current source. The electrode with negative polarity is better than positive polarity as far as frost accumulation is concerned. The low-frequency oscillation is ineffective in defrosting while ultrasonic vibration provides effective frost removal and can delay the frost growth appreciably. Test results indicate that the ultrasonic oscillation poses considerable positive influence on defrosting either operated continuously or intermittently, in direct contact or not. For system defrosting, the hot gas reverse cycle is comparatively expensive to install but the efficiency, {COP}, and energy consumption are superior to the other system methods. Desiccants, either solid or liquid, can be employed in association with the system defrosting methods to lower energy consumption. There were various controlling strategies to detect the frost formation and to decide the best time to initiate defrosting. However, many of them were applicable to some specific systems and environments and require further investigations to test the relevant reliability, stability, and repeatability.},

However, in almost all the studies, ethylene glycol water solution was used as refrigerant, which made the investigating of frost distribution and growth difficult due to the uneven temperature distribution along the tube length. Furthermore, quantitative experimental data for the frost distribution and growth on {FTHXs} have been insufficient. Therefore, in this paper, a quantitative experimental study using R410A as refrigerant on frost distribution and growth on two {FTHXs} with different fin pitches is reported. The study results demonstrated that the frost accumulated on an {FTHX} could be divided into two parts, one accumulated on the edge of windward fins and the other on the surfaces of fins and tubes. Furthermore, the ratios of the frost mass accumulated on the edge of windward fins to that on the entire {FTHX} surface were 13.7\% (60 min frosting duration) and 12.5\% (120 min frosting duration) for the two {FTHXs}, respectively.

	abstract = {During winter operation, an air-source heat pump extracts heat from the cold outside air and releases the heat into the living space. At certain outside air conditions, when it operates in heating mode, frost can form on the air-cooled heat exchanger, decreasing the heating performance. Conventionally, reverse-cycle defrosting ({RCD}) has been the common method of frost removal. But this method requires the interruption of heating during defrosting, as well as a period of time to reheat the cooled pipes of the indoor units after defrosting. In this study, a new technology called continuous heating was developed, which utilize only a hot gas bypass valve to remove the frost from the outdoor heat exchanger and thus enabling the supply of hot air to indoors without any interruption. For this, a new high temperature and low pressure gas bypass method was designed, which is differentiated from the common high pressure hot gas bypass methods by its use of low pressure. Various refrigerant mass flow distributions were examined, and the most effective defrosting mass flow was 50\% in this case. Heating capacity was increased by 17\% because of continuous heating, and the cumulated energy efficiency was increased by 8\% compared to the traditional reverse cycle defrosting over 4h including two defrost operations. Also, cumulated energy efficiency was increased by 27\% compared to electronic heaters that supply the same heating capacity during defrosting. By this new technology, it has been proved that continuous heating and energy savings could be achieved without adopting expensive technologies.},

Yearly simulations are run for two types of buildings and nine European climates, for both heating and cooling (where needed), in order to have an overview of the system behaviour, which is deeply influenced by the climate. The storage system (electrical and thermal) is also investigated, by means of multiple simulation scenarios, with and without the battery and with different water storage sizes. The numerical results provide an overview of the performance of the considered heating and cooling system, as well as the balance of the electrical energy exchange between the grid, the building, and the {PV} array.},

	abstract = {The effect of the frost growth and frost morphology on the performance of an air source heat pump was investigated experimentally. The frost thickness, frost accumulation and the dynamic performance of the heat pump were measured. It is found that the frost growth can be divided into three stages according to the frost morphology. In the initial stage, condensed water freezes and forms a transparent thin ice layer on the fins and tubes firstly, then the granular ices appear and grow gradually on the ice layer, and the column-shaped ice crystals are formed at last. The growth rate of the frost thickness, the heating capacity and {COP} of the heat pump increase with the frosting time significantly until the column-shaped frost layer is formed. In the second stage, the column-shaped ice crystals grow in its radius rather than in its length, and the frost thickness growth rate decreases or remains to be constant. However, the heating capacity and {COP} of the heat pump are only slightly affected by frosting on the outdoor coils. In the third stage, the ice crystals mainly grow in its length, and become gradually of an acerose-shaped one, finally a fluffy frost layer is formed. The frost thickness growth rate is about 2–4 times of that in the second stage. The drops per minute in the heating capacity and {COP} are increased by several times of those in the second stage. In addition, it is found that the frost growth rate and the drop in the performance of the heat pump are highest when the outdoor air temperature is about 0°C with various relative humidity. The experimental results are in agreement with the corresponding simulation data except in the third frosting stage.},

	abstract = {Nowadays heat pumps ({HPs}) represent the main alternative to traditional heating systems for the transition to nearly zero-energy buildings. Though {HPs} are a well-known technology, the estimation of their actual energy performance is still under discussion. Indeed, the proper choice of the {HP} design parameters (e.g. size, rated supply temperature) and the adopted control strategy can assume a paramount role to cover the mismatch between declared and actual performance of the system. Objective of this work is to analyze this mutual dependence in an operating system to provide guidelines for the design of a residential heating system with a {HP}. Through a dynamic energy simulation tool, a variable-load air-to-water {HP} is used to cover the thermal demand of a residential building. The effect of the reciprocal influence of different design choices (e.g. rated heating capacity or design supply temperature) and control strategies (e.g. climatic regulation) is analyzed by simulating different scenarios. To complete the evaluation, the impact of a thermal energy storage is also assessed. The study allows to identify guidelines for the design of different system configurations and results seem to confirm the impact of the investigated parameters on the seasonal performance of the system.},

While air source heat pumps can provide outstanding performance at high ambient temperatures, their efficiency (strictly their coefficient of performance) and capacity both degrade at low ambient temperatures when heating demand is highest. Some homeowners utilize hybrid (or dualfuel) heating systems, which use a heat pump at high ambient temperatures and a furnace at lower temperatures when the heat pump's capacity is insufficient. These hybrid systems allow the homeowner to avoid the additional capital cost of installing a larger heat pump to meet peak heating demand. This study discusses heating choices for single family homes that currently use a central air unit for cooling alongside a natural gas orfuel oilfurnace for heating. We determine that in most {US} climate zones, it is prudent to replace an air conditioner at the end of its life with a heat pump sizedfor the peak cooling load and operate it in tandem with the existing furnace. We also assess the emission implications of such a conversion and determine the electricity prices below which a homeowner will break even over the investment's lifetime.},

	abstract = {The residential heating sector can offer significant load-shifting possibilities to the energy system. Currently 400,000 households in Denmark are heated by natural gas boilers. The power consumption corresponding to these boilers can offer high value to the stabilization of the wind intensive Danish energy system. Gas electric hybrid heat pumps ({GEHHPs}) are individual heat pumps consisting of an electric heat pump and a gas boiler. They enable a fully flexible operation of electric heat pumps by supplementing electricity with gas when necessary. In this paper, we construct a cost optimization model of a {GEHHP} and compare the levelized cost of heat of this system with other individual heating systems. We investigate the changes in the operation schedule of the {GEHHP}, both from a socio- and a private-economic perspective, and analyze how certain economic and technological framework conditions influence their operation schedule. Our article shows that the end-consumer's optimal operation schedule uses the gas boiler component of the {GEHHP} 24\% of the time. Additionally, comparing the levelized cost of heat of the {GEHHP} with other heating alternatives proves that the {GEHHP} setup is the most cost efficient individual heating alternative.

A residential building located in Stuttgart, Germany, equipped with a hybrid heat pump which is coupled with a thermal energy storage unit and a gas boiler is used as a case study. A model predictive control algorithm is used to minimise the daily operational cost over a full heating season. Several demand response programs based on controlling the heat pump power consumption were tested and analysed by adopting different metrics capable of describing the flexibility potential and cost of demand response programs. Several tariff structures, including: real-time pricing, two-level day-night tariffs and critical-peak pricing with both fixed and variable feed-in price components, were investigated. The results show that the building can provide up to 1370 {kWhe} of energy flexibility over the heating season with an average specific (marginal) costs of between €0.024–0.035 per {kWhe} of flexibility provided. The demand response programs lead to higher utilisation of thermal energy storage along with increased boiler consumption, by up to 17.1\% and 12.1\%, respectively in case of maximum demand response intensity. This in turn leads to a higher overall primary energy consumption of between 1.6\% and 9.1\% depending on demand response intensity. Typically, real-time pricing is the most favourable tariff structure, capable of offering the greatest energy flexibility with lowest associated electricity costs.},

A high efficiency natural gas furnace ({NGF}) and an electric air source heat pump ({ASHP}) were coupled together to meet the space heating demand of the house. This integrated system is called the cloud based Smart Dual Fuel Switching System ({SDFSS}) that considers time-of-use ({TOU}) pricing, fuel cost, short-term weather forecast, and equipment efficiencies and capacities. This multi-variable decision-making process defines an optimal schedule for the hybrid system to run more cost effectively. This paper analyses two separate {SDFSSs}. According to these analyses, the {SDFSS} systems showed lower operating cost with respect to the furnace or the {ASHP} system alone with various carbon tax ({CT}) levels from \$0 to \$250/tonne of {CT} with an increment of \$10/tonne of {CT} that were simulated, along with a significant {GHG} emission reduction relative to the conventional heating systems. Furthermore, with these technologies, Canada’s residential sector could potentially meet Canada’s Paris Agreement goals. The {SDFSS} technology is a is flexible, user friendly, ubiquitous technology for the smooth transition from today’s natural gas dominated space heating system to the future’s low carbon infrastructure powered by a heat pump and renewable energy.},

	abstract = {Hybrid heat pump systems are a suitable solution to mitigate the well-known disadvantages of air-source heat pumps, such as energy losses linked to defrost cycles and a significant reduction of their heating capacity during the most severe part of the season. In hybrid systems the heat pump is sized to satisfy only a fraction of the building peak load and is coupled to a second heater (back-up device), which helps the heat pump during the coldest part of the winter. In this paper, a series of dynamic simulations has been performed to calculate the seasonal performance of hybrid systems based on an air-to-water heat pump and to assess the optimal configuration of the system. Results point out that the energy performance of these systems strongly depends on the heat pump sizing, the back-up device typology and the control algorithm used for the activation of the heat generators. It is demonstrated that the adoption of hybrid systems in which the heat pump is coupled to a gas boiler allows to obtain relevant primary energy savings. The overall seasonal efficiency can be increased up to 6\% and 22\%, if compared to monovalent systems respectively based on a heat pump or a gas boiler, only if the heaters are activated following an alternative operating mode, with a cut-off temperature selected between the design and the bivalent temperature. On the contrary, if the back-up device of the hybrid system is an electric resistance, the heaters have to work in parallel during the whole heating season and the only achievable advantage is that the heat pump can be slightly under-sized with respect to the nominal building load.},

	abstract = {The ongoing decarbonisation process of the current energy system, driven by the {EU} directives, requires that more renewable energy sources are integrated in the global energy mix, as well as policies promoting investments in new low-carbon technologies, energy efficiency and grid infrastructure. The technical integration of renewable energy sources into the existing power system is not straightforward, due to the intrinsic aleatory characteristics of renewable production, which make the power grid balance harder. To handle this issue, beside the traditional supply-side management, grid flexibility can also be provided by enabling the active participation of the demand-side in power system operational procedures, by means of the so-called demand-side management ({DSM}). The present paper is aimed at assessing the ability of a cost-optimal control strategy, based on model predictive control, to activate demand-response ({DR}) actions in a residential building equipped with a hybrid heat pump generator coupled with a water thermal storage. Hourly electricity prices are considered as external signals from the grid driving the demand response actions. It is shown that the thermal energy storage turns out to be an effective way to improve the controller performances and make the system more flexible and able to provide services to the power grid. A daily cost-saving up to 35\% and 15\% have been highlighted with a 1 m3 0.5.m3 tanks, respectively. Finally, the achievable flexibility is shown to be strictly dependent on the storage capacity and operations, which in turn are affected by the generators sizing.},

Although much research has been conducted to make up for weak points of heat pumps which occur when their purpose is converted from air-conditioning into water heating, there remain some points to be improved to perform as stably as conventional water heaters. Recently, the hybrid water heating system, which is the combination of a heat pump and a traditional gas fired water heater, is proposed as an alternative water heater to perform more efficient water heating stably. In this paper, the hybrid system is designed for general residential houses in Korea, which have floor area of 106.47m2 and its performance characteristics are analyzed numerically. To obtain the performance of a hybrid water heating system, the mathematical models of heat pump components and the correlation, which is derived from experimental data of a gas fired water heater, are applied. Also, using the result of a performance calculation, the economic feasibility study is carried out, with the concept of energy cost savings, to quantify the merits of the system and to establish its operation strategy. The monthly electricity and heat consumption data in a Korean residential house and the price of electricity and gas are applied to reflect an actual situation.},

	abstract = {Air-to-water heat pumps ({HPs}) are widely installed in new buildings; however, they face performance degradation with high temperature emission systems, which is typical of existing buildings, or during domestic hot water ({DHW}) production. Hybrid systems ({HSs}), composed by air-to-water {HPs} and gas-fired boilers, can mitigate these issues by increasing the overall system efficiency. {HS} performance is strictly dependent on the configuration and control management of the system itself. Moreover, the building and heating plant also have a strong influence. This study presents an overview of the application of {HSs} that considers both space heating ({SH}) and {DHW} production, by comparing the primary energy ({PE}) consumption obtained by dynamic simulations. Different climates, building typologies, and {DHW} withdrawal profiles are used to extend the results’ validity. Additionally, several {HS} control strategies were implemented and compared. The results show a {PE} savings ranging from 5\% to 22\% depending on the control strategy and the external parameters applied in the simulation. The comparison of the control strategies shows that the most efficient strategies are the ones maximizing heat pump utilization. The dependence of {PE} savings of {HS} on {COP} values is highlighted, and a correlation is presented to provide designers with guidance on the applicability of {HSs}.},

	abstract = {Air source heat pumps have a well known unfavourable characteristic: in the coldest period of the year, when the building heating load is at maximum, the heat pump capacity is reduced. A possible solution is to size the heat pump to cover only a fraction of the peak load using a second heat generator in “hybrid heat pump system”. In this study, a dynamic model of a hybrid system was built, and several seasonal simulations were carried out (considering two different climates) to study how the choice of the cut off temperature can influence the annual efficiency of the system and to understand if a bivalent parallel plant can lead to energy savings compared to a bivalent alternative system. With both the considered climates, when a large size heat pump is selected (low bivalent temperature), there might be no benefits by setting a cut off temperature lower than the bivalent temperature, and the differences between the energy performances of the bivalent alternative system and those of the bivalent parallel system are negligible. On the other hand, when a low size heat pump is preferred (high bivalent temperature), the bivalent parallel system can lead to appreciable energy savings compared to a bivalent alternative plant. The main economic advantages of a hybrid system, with respect to the monovalent heat-pump plant, comes from the lower annual electric and gas energy needs.},

In this study, the parallel loop hybrid system with the combination of heat pump and gas fired water heater in one device is provided as the sustainable alternative to alleviate such issues. An economic-based new control strategy has been proposed for the hybrid system to investigate the system thermal performance and reveal the economic benefits for residential space heating application. The climate conditions, fuel source price ratio and gas heater thermal efficiency have been included in the analysis of the hybrid performance. Under the operating map, the control strategy can lead to a ∼10\% to ∼60\% system operating economic benefits for space heating application for −12 °C to 20 °C ambient. Raising the price ratio can decrease the ratio of the heat delivered by the heat pump on the overall heat loading, especially for higher final water target temperatures. Lowering the price ratio can improve the energy process saving potential (\% gas heater heating mode baseline). In addition, several typical cities have also been investigated as a part of studies for hybrid performances and environmental impacts.},

This problem is often solved by adding an electrical heating element, but the low efficiency of such a solution makes it worthwhile to adopt a hybrid system consisting of a heat pump combined with a condensing boiler, which can operate even when the heat pump's performance falls below that of the boiler. The purpose of this paper is to assess the energy performance of a hybrid unit by means of dynamic simulations, comparing it with a heat pump with electrical integration in a single-family home built in the 1970s and located in Milan. In a previous study, the same model was used to perform a similar analysis on a Stirling {microCHP} unit, so the present work completes the analysis of the most innovative generators for space heating in residential buildings. The simulations showed that hybrid systems can achieve a high generation efficiency whereas heat pumps with electrical integration are unable to improve on the generation efficiency of a condensing gas boiler in the case examined.},

In this work, a hybrid heat pump system for existing buildings consisting of a retrofitted air–water heat pump and a gas boiler is modeled and examined in full-year dynamic numerical simulations. It is benchmarked with comparable monovalent systems for a 1970s’ single family home as well as a renovated variant of the same building. The nominal thermal output of the {AWHP} as well as the volume of the buffer storage tank are varied in order to study their impact on system performance. With the renovated building model, significantly higher efficiencies ({SPF} 3.88 vs. 3.34) and load factors (0.57 vs. 0.36) are achieved. Medium-sized heat pumps attain the highest {SPF} values, the reason for which is rooted in the alternative-parallel bivalent operation scheme and the dependency of the bivalence point on the heat pump characteristic. The volume of the buffer storage tank has very limited impact on system performance.},

	abstract = {The present paper investigates possible primary energy savings deriving from the utilization of air to air heat pumps for building heating purposes. The energy input of heat pumps is generally represented by electricity and, in the last years, the share of renewables on the total electricity generation has grown in all the industrialized world, therefore the average carbon emission factor has decreased. According to this scenario, heat pumps maybe conveniently employed for heating purposes in the residential sector to support its de-carbonization through the substitution of natural gas boilers. The impact of the heat pump utilization is analyzed by implementing a simpliﬁed end-use energy model. The model is based on the deﬁnition of the Carnot efﬁciency of an inverse cycle, which permits to estimate the performance of a heat pump in a direct and simple way according to the indoor and outdoor temperature of the location of installation. Then, a simple methodology is introduced to obtain an estimation of territorial energy consumption, so that different scenarios can be analyzed and planning or policy evaluations can be proposed. Finally, a case of study is considered to show the practical application of the proposed method.},

The use of air–water heat pumps is restricted by high required flow temperatures and heat output but can be mitigated by hybrid heat pumps. To limit additional operation costs by the heat pump, a new operation strategy is introduced in this study, which allows to maintain a target {CO}2 emission. The operation strategy is applied in a field trial in a small unrenovated multifamily house built in 1964. A thermohydraulic simulation model is verified and is used in full-year simulations to apply improvement measures and compare the new control strategy with existing optimizing strategies. The results show that the control onto target emissions is possible and limits additional costs but can also result in higher {CO}2 mitigation costs, making it less favorable. The hybrid heat pump reduces the direct fossil {CO}2 emissions by 61\% (in total by 22\%); thus, it is a relevant solution for multifamily houses, especially within a further decarbonized electrical grid.},

Hence, it becomes more challenging for existing simulation tools to provide integrated solutions for these multi-physics problems. Moreover, common building simulation frameworks tightly integrate model equations and their solvers in the program code, which affects model transparency and hampers tool extensions. This is contrasted by equation-based tools such as Modelica, for which different solvers can be used.
