	abstract = {This simulation study adapts and applies the general framework described in {BESTEST}-{EX} (Judkoff et al 2010) for self-testing residential building energy model calibration methods. {BEopt}/{DOE}-2.2 is used to evaluate four mathematical calibration methods in the context of monthly, daily, and hourly synthetic utility data for a 1960's-era existing home in a cooling-dominated climate. The home's model inputs are assigned probability distributions representing uncertainty ranges, random selections are made from the uncertainty ranges to define 'explicit' input values, and synthetic utility billing data are generated using the explicit input values. The four calibration methods evaluated in this study are: an {ASHRAE} 1051-{RP}-based approach (Reddy and Maor 2006), a simplified simulated annealing optimization approach, a regression metamodeling optimization approach, and a simple output ratio calibration approach. The calibration methods are evaluated for monthly, daily, and hourly cases; various retrofit measures are applied to the calibrated models and the methods are evaluated based on the accuracy of predicted savings, computational cost, repeatability, automation, and ease of implementation.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, there is growing interest in all the smart technologies that provide us with information and knowledge about the human environment. In the energy field, thanks to the amount of data received from smart meters and devices and the progress made in both energy software and computers, the quality of energy models is gradually improving and, hence, also the suitability of Energy Conservation Measures ({ECMs}). For this reason, the measurement of the accuracy of building energy models is an important task, because once the model is validated through a calibration procedure, it can be used, for example, to apply and study different strategies to reduce its energy consumption in maintaining human comfort. There are several agencies that have developed guidelines and methodologies to establish a measure of the accuracy of these models, and the most widely recognized are: {ASHRAE} Guideline 14-2014, the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol ({IPMVP}) and the Federal Energy Management Program ({FEMP}). This article intends to shed light on these validation measurements (uncertainty indices) by focusing on the typical mistakes made, as these errors could produce a false belief that the models used are calibrated.},

	abstract = {Whole building energy simulation ({BES}) models play a significant role in the design and optimisation of buildings. Simulation models may be used to compare the cost-effectiveness of energy-conservation measures ({ECMs}) in the design stage as well as assessing various performance optimisation measures during the operational stage. However, due to the complexity of the built environment and prevalence of large numbers of independent interacting variables, it is difficult to achieve an accurate representation of real-world building operation. Therefore, by reconciling model outputs with measured data, we can achieve more accurate and reliable results. This reconciliation of model outputs with measured data is known as calibration. This paper presents a detailed review of current approaches to model development and calibration, highlighting the importance of uncertainty in the calibration process. This is accompanied by a detailed assessment of the various analytical and mathematical/statistical tools employed by practitioners to date, as well as a discussion on both the problems and the merits of the presented approaches.},

	abstract = {Surveys show that the mean absolute percentage error ({MAPE}) is the most widely used measure of prediction accuracy in businesses and organizations. It is, however, biased: when used to select among competing prediction methods it systematically selects those whose predictions are too low. This has not been widely discussed and so is not generally known among practitioners. We explain why this happens. We investigate an alternative relative accuracy measure which avoids this bias: the log of the accuracy ratio, that is, log (prediction/actual). Relative accuracy is particularly relevant if the scatter in the data grows as the value of the variable grows (heteroscedasticity). We demonstrate using simulations that for heteroscedastic data (modelled by a multiplicative error factor) the proposed metric is far superior to {MAPE} for model selection. Another use for accuracy measures is in fitting parameters to prediction models. Minimum {MAPE} models do not predict a simple statistic and so theoretical analysis is limited. We prove that when the proposed metric is used instead, the resulting least squares regression model predicts the geometric mean. This important property allows its theoretical properties to be understood.},

	abstract = {The mean absolute percentage error ({MAPE}) is one of the most widely used measures of forecast accuracy, due to its advantages of scale-independency and interpretability. However, {MAPE} has the significant disadvantage that it produces infinite or undefined values for zero or close-to-zero actual values. In order to address this issue in {MAPE}, we propose a new measure of forecast accuracy called the mean arctangent absolute percentage error ({MAAPE}). {MAAPE} has been developed through looking at {MAPE} from a different angle. In essence, {MAAPE} is a slope as an angle, while {MAPE} is a slope as a ratio, considering a triangle with adjacent and opposite sides that are equal to an actual value and the difference between the actual and forecast values, respectively. {MAAPE} inherently preserves the philosophy of {MAPE}, overcoming the problem of division by zero by using bounded influences for outliers in a fundamental manner through considering the ratio as an angle instead of a slope. The theoretical properties of {MAAPE} are investigated, and the practical advantages are demonstrated using both simulated and real-life data.},
